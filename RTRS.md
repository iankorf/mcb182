RTRS Topics
===========

RTRS is "Real Time with a Real Scientist". These short, 20 minute sessions, are
designed to get students to interact in small groups. One of the main reasons
to go to college is to be part of a cohort. Kids these days spend a lot of time
in the phones not interacting with the people they go to class with. This is an
effort to enrich their college experience.

RTRS topics should be provacative, but not too controversial. It's best to stay
away from religious and sexual themes. Some ideas follow.
